# QuizBuilder

<h2>Background:</h2>
Teachers world over use quizzes as a way to guage a student's progress, to get additional marks in the grade book, and perhaps to give a student feedback regarding their progress. I, however, believe that thinking about the quiz as a signpost to help guage if someone is on track to learning the material has many advantages.

Rather like driving to a distant location with a map and GPS tracking sytem, the signs on the road help the driver decide if they are on the right route. If somehow one gets off track, the signs alert the driver, so they can make the appropriate changes. Quizzes can function the same way. 

If George does not do well on a particular quiz it may be that he is just tired, feels crummy, or the teacher did teach it well. But, it could also be the George does not understand the concepts. He needs to put in more time to learn that materialâ€”in his spare time. Everyone knows how much of that most people have. If George screws up a few more quizzes, then chances are that he won't remember what material to review when he finally does get that breather. 

I suggest that if meta information is attached to each question in the quiz, then the data from several quizzes can be accumulated and used to generate a personalized review guide.

<h2>General Proposal</h2>
I propose an app to build a personalized review guide that could be used by individuals to review for a test, to review material covered in a course that they did not grasp well enough, or simply as a way to remind them of work covered in a previous course.

This, obviously, is a very ambitious project; therefore, it has to be broken down into separate modules. Some of the critical modules would include:
<ul>
	<li>Login and authentication of teacher or student users</li>
	<li>The ability to build a quiz by an authenticated teacher {QuizBuilder module}</li>
	<li>The ability for the teacher to access different subject material as a source of the questions.</li>
	<li>The ability to c</li>
	<li>lkjlkj</li>
</ul>


The QuizBuilder will allow a teacher to build a quiz, attach metatags to each question, have comments regarding the questions or answers from other users (teachers), and preview the quiz.
